# Investigating the feasibility of using machine learning to predict housing price

## Abstract
This thesis investigates the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to predict housing prices in London by postal district, utilising a dataset ranging from 1995 to 2021 from the HM Land Registry. The research deploys three machine learning algorithms—ARIMA, XGBoost, MLP and an ensemble model—to forecast monthly average housing prices for the year 2022. By incorporating additional socio-economic and infrastructural indicators, the study aims to enhance the predictive accuracy beyond traditional models. The evaluation of these models against actual 2022 data demonstrates varying levels of success, with the ensemble approach combining the strengths of all three models yielding the most reliable predictions. This thesis underscores the potential of advanced machine learning algorithms in providing detailed, accurate, and location-specific housing price forecasts, thereby offering valuable insights for stakeholders navigating the complexities of London's real estate market.
