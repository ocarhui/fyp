# Project Plan

## Name: Oscar Hui
## Project Title: Investigating the feasibility of using machine learning to predict housing price and index prediction
## Supervisor: Mr. Vadgama Nikhil
## Aims and Objectives:
“To learn about the trends of pricing within housing industry within London"

1. Review	 the	 ‘protein	 folding	 problem’	 and	 previous	 techniques	 for	
predicting	protein	folds	from	amino	acid	(primary)	sequence,	in	particular	
those	using	artificial	neural	networks.	

1. Develop	software	tools	that	can	pre-process	primary	sequence	data	using	
Fourier	 transform	 methods	 in	 order	 to	 produce	 fixed-length	 data	 vectors	
suitable	as	inputs	for	neural	network	training.

1. Develop	an	appropriate	neural	network	model	that	can	use	the	above	data	
vectors	as	input	and	as	its	output	classify	amino	acid	sequences	into	one	of	a	
number	of	fold	types.

1. Evaluate	the	success	of	the	method	using	Fourier	pre-processing	compared	
with	 previous	 neural	 network	 based	 fold	 type	 predictors,	 and	 with	 other	
forms	of	structure	predictor	(for	example	those	using	logic	programming).

## Expected outcomes/deliverables
- A	literature	survey	that	summarises	previous	work	in	your	specialist	area	
in	a	way	that	makes	in	accessible	to	a	more	general	reader

- Results	obtained	 from	gathering	available	data,	questionnaires	and	so	on,	
with	statistical	analysis	and	discussion	of	their	significance

- A	new	model	or	algorithm	developed	(by	yourself	or	in	collaboration	with	
your	supervisor)	to	solve	your	project’s	underlying	problem

- A	design	specification	for	a	software	application	or	equivalent	specification	
for	relevant	deliverables.

- A	fully documented and functional	piece of software or equivalent.

- A	strategy for testing and evaluating	your software or equivalent

## Work Plan
- Project	start	to	end of	October	(4	weeks)	Literature	search	and	review
